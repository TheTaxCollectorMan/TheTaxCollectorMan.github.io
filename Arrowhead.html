			<h1>ARROWHEAD</h1>
			<div class="box inset">
				<p>Arrowhead is a Half-Life 2 mod set during the so-called “First Days,” where Xen flora and 
					fauna, however briefly, ruled the Earth. Drawing from authors like Stephen King, 
					Marc Laidlaw, a variety of pulp sci-fi writers, and just about anything else that
					catches my eye, my work on 
					Arrowhead is intended to be a love letter to Half-Life, creature features, 
					and the general aesthetic of classic science fiction and horror in all its forms.

						I’ve written over 20,000 words of Arrowhead narrative content, not 
						including promotional or development material. Below is what I can 
						share without spoilers! This includes pre-release narrative content 
						and a selection of vignettes, which are long and descriptive short 
						stories written to help level designers, artists, and audio producers. They can be
						accessed by clicking on the images below. I hope you enjoy them! </p>

				<h1>Logs from Dale R.</h1>
				<div class="box inset">
					<p><div class="box rounded">“Then, a groan louder than anything vibrated through the dull, eviscerated 
						corridors of a Black Mesa that had been abandoned for two thousand years. I looked 
						out and saw a corridor that I know for a fact has never existed here. It was 
						pitch-black but there was something there. I don’t know how to bring it into 
						any meaning or justification. It was alive and dead, or sentient and non-sentient. 
						Old and new. There was another groan that split through everything, and there was 
						light at the end of that awful fake tunnel. Orange, and then green… barrelling at 
						me like a train. There was a howl as it approached, like a train through a tunnel 
						made of open, screaming faces. Then, as it appeared to split through the darkness, 
						as though it was a barrier, I woke up. I never caught sight of what it was. Perhaps 
						there was nothing to see at all, just a figment of a concept my brain conjured up to 
						scare the hell out of me.”</div>

						A series of daily logs released in real-time as a teaser focusing on Dale Rogers, 
						a character we meet in Arrowhead, during his time as a member of the Black Mesa 
						Research Facility. Grappling with his rapidly shifting thoughts on consciousness, 
						his job, and even his own morality, he is inevitably displaced from the facility 
						after the Resonance Cascade, though not before a vague but distressing encounter 
						leaves him questioning everything. I started this by wondering how a fairly normal 
						engineer at Black Mesa might view the insane experiments going on around him, though 
						it quickly shifted in a direction I didn’t expect. I'm really satisfied 
						with the final piece, so no complaints from me!

			<h1>THE STORE</h1>
			<div class="box inset">
				<p><div class="box rounded">“Sawyer’s first sensation was the stench of decaying meat. 
					The second was the unpleasant, sterile flickering of fluorescent strips. These lights 
					shone quite a bit brighter than the ones that stayed on, but did just the opposite. They 
					flashed at points in the store like lightning, and then went dark. In brief blue-tinted 
					flits they illuminated dioramas of a world gone horrifically insane; some zombies stumbled 
					around to nowhere with an uncomprehending shock. Others were slumped on tiles or against 
					upright shelves as though dead. Whether this was a trick or a form of sleep with unknowable 
					dreams was something he couldn’t bring himself to dwell on.”
				</div>

				Written over the course of three days, The Store was basically my first contribution to 
				Arrowhead. I really wanted to do a dark, isolated space with zombies, and a superstore 
				seemed like a perfect fit! This was obviously unfeasible to build in-game at the time due 
				to the complexity of the space along with the asset density it would require, but 
				it was still an incredibly fun way to figure out how we’d handle the more atmospheric 
				survival horror aspects of any setting.

				<h1>THE CANYON</h1>
				<div class="box inset">
					<p><div class="box rounded">“The shot cracked across the arroyo, puncturing a crazed 
						shriek with a noise that had become much more natural in his hands. The nest of 
						eyes exploded like a dozen hatching egg sacs, and he had the brief but insane vision 
						of hundreds of blind and unfeeling spiders squirming out of its head to devour its 
						corpse. Instead, the wet scraps of eyeball simply glistened under the setting sun as 
						clear juice and yellowish gunk spilled out of its cavernous head. Its paw raised 
						weakly, swiped at the air, and then it finally laid silent. Its pack went on 
						without it, not stopping for a second.”
					</div>

					Longer and more complex, The Canyon was written with more intent to provide a 
					blueprint for a potential level, albeit in a dramatized fashion. As we narrowed 
					in on setting a portion of the game in a national park, I thought it would be fun to 
					play with power dynamics, with a long journey to reach a group of creatures harassing 
					you from above. This bloomed into a trek through canyons, a cave, and a dried-out riverbed, 
					with lots of fun surprises along the way. Heavily inspired by the indie game Firewatch, 
					I wanted to imagine how a natural space could twist and become more hazardous due to 
					influence from alien forces, which is a major theme in Arrowhead. 
					Overall, I’m happy with what I was able to portray!
