			<h1>WRITING</h1>
			<div class="box inset">
				<p>Short stories I’m willing to convince myself to make public! 
					Quality varies by date. All stories are hosted off-site. 
					This CSS is really neat, but I’m guessing you don’t want to read 2000+ 
					words on it.

					I write a lot, but I’m really particular about what I show. Here are some of my favourites!

			<h1>WALKING THROUGH A FOREST THAT LOATHES HIS PRESENCE (2019)</h1>
			<div class="box inset">
				<p>A criminal on the run in an unusual place makes a desperate bargain 
					with a questionable ally. 
<BR>
	<BR>
					Written in 2019, this is the oldest story here. The writing isn’t 
					great, and the dialogue is abysmal, but I’m still thinking about the 
					setting years later, which is a decent enough argument for its 
					preservation here. My brain nags me to continue this story a lot. 
					Maybe one day I will?

			<h1>PUMPKIN (2020)</h1>
			<div class="box inset">
				<p>On Halloween night, one man starts to become uneasy about a pumpkin 
					he purchased on a whim.
<BR>
	<BR>
					Written and edited in two hours on Halloween night! This one came 
					right out in a way I wish I could replicate. One of my weaknesses is 
					buildup--I’m a lot like a reader who just can’t wait until shit goes 
					sideways--but I managed to restrain myself for long enough here. It’s a 
					personal favourite of mine.

					<p>At the end of his rope, a man dedicates himself to a Sisyphean 
						plunge into the madness within 527 authentic Chinese fortune cookies.
<BR>
	<BR>
						Written over a few days based on a prompt I wish I could 
						remember. An interesting case where I’ve had some readers call it 
						a comedy and other, completely separate readers call it a 
						straight-up horror story. Read it and come to your own conclusion, 
						I guess!
