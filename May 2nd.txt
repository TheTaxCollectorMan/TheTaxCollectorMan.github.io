May 2nd

Saw Dr. Braun today. Apparently yesterday’s incident made quite a mess, so an entire wing of the biological lab is under a temporary quarantine until they can sanitize it. We’ll be getting quite an influx of biologists until they’re able to return at some point next week. Better than holding them in another sector, I suppose, with wide-eyed undergrads asking them about the stains on their coats and the look of resigned awareness in their eyes. I suppose we’re sister divisions, in a way. Perhaps symbiotic is the more correct word. I’m disappointed I can’t count Perl among the ranks of the misplaced, seeing as he works on the other end of the contaminated side of the lab. Hopefully he can find the time to visit soon.

Lots of power outages and shakes today. If there’s any small gratitude I have, it’s for our separation from the rest of the Black Mesa power grid. I never get used to them, though; I left one of my favourite mugs too close to the edge of my desk and a tremor shattered it. I hate feeling unusually clumsy, but I always had trouble adapting to random patterns. I’m just glad I don’t work too close to the portal. I call them tremors. They call them earthquakes.

Very excited for a trip to the library tomorrow. It’s been awhile since I rode the tram. I’m well-stocked on scopolamine, thankfully. If there’s one positive to working in an area with potentially the highest concentration of licensed doctors in America, it’s stress-free medication refills. I’ll take a bit tonight and a bit in the morning. One last thing to be grateful about: Effective sleep-aids.
