No dreams.

The Lambda team got back to me today. They’re more than happy with the prototype and want to move into manufacturing. They have my go-ahead, I want it out of my hands now.

Perl says he’s visiting tomorrow, and I only hope my gratitude is properly carried over in my response email. I can’t imagine a circumstance that would prevent him from coming, but I can’t be too confident. The only person I’ve had to talk to openly these last few weeks is myself, and it’s starting to feel like I’m eating away at myself. I have a lot I need to get off my chest.

Managed to leave my office and greet a few co-workers today. They seemed relieved. Did Dr. Byrnes tell anyone what happened? He seemed concerned when we last spoke, but I don’t know if he was discrete enough to keep it to himself. Overall, it left me feeling better. I’ll try to get out more this week.

I looked over the QFC one final time today. It’s too late to make anything more than minor changes to the design, so hopefully Perl is happy with it. I would’ve quite liked his input earlier, but if I can impress him, I’ll be happy. 

Getting to bed early tonight. It feels nice to finally have something to be excited about.

Signed,
Dale R.
