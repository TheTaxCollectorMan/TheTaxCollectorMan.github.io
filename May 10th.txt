May 10th

The prototype is finished ahead of schedule. I had expected to finish soon, but not today. The parts I expected to be complicated turned out to come along quite easily. Emailed Dr. Byrnes, with some hesitation, to let him know I’ll be able to demonstrate it tomorrow. I almost hope I’ll come back with a whole list of needed adjustments, or that a freak mechanical failure will occur. Anything to keep me busy.

The office feels emptier without the biologists, and far too quiet. I left to get a bottle of water and didn’t see a single person between my office and the fridge. Not even a security guard. It never occurred to me how few security guards we have in this area of the facility. I saw fourteen security cameras on my walk and not a single, actual person. I never thought about how closely they must watch those tapes, over and over. Looking for what? Corporate spies? Someone in a restricted area? Something else?

Had the insane urge to tear my room apart looking for hidden cameras or listening devices. I’m feeling increasingly distracted and paranoid. I have less fear that it will interfere with my work and more fear that I won’t have any work. I’m being paid six figures to sit around tinkering and all I want is to find the nearest senior associate and demand he assign me something hard and time-consuming. Maybe I just need to leave the office more. I’ll try to find something to get me out of Sector F after I’m done presenting tomorrow.
